# Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction to RL
We will learn about the basic concepts of RL and algorithms it uses. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), 
value functions and dynamic programming, model-free methods (such as Q-learning, Monte Carlo methods, and Temporal Difference learning), and Deep RL are key contents when we enter learning RL.

In this course, we will practice two methods, policy iteration and value iteration in Task 1 and 2. Use one of the gym environments in category 'Toy Text'.
In task 3, use one of the RL methods available in stable baselines, and one of the gym environments not chosen in task 1 and 2. Plot the reward graph and show the save points on the grpah using callback function.
Please refer to the example code (policy_iteration.py, value_iteration.py).
